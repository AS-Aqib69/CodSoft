Task 2: Portfolio Completed

I've learned about responsive web design during this project, ensuring that my portfolio looks excellent on a variety of devices. My experience with debugging issues and cross-browser compatibility has taught me how to troubleshoot and offer a positive user experience. I have a solid foundation in HTML and CSS now that I've worked on this project, and I'm also more aware of web design principles and user-friendly content structure. As I take on additional tasks and investigate cutting-edge technologies, I'm eager to gain new skills and progress as a web developer.

Task 3: Calculator Completed

In result, learning how to build a simple calculator with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has been a valuable experience. Through this project, I've learned useful tips for developing websites, from organizing the user interface to processing user input and putting calculating logic into place. It is evidence of the potency of fusing key technologies to produce useful and engaging online apps. I'm anxious to expand on this foundation as I go forward, investigate trickier tasks, and hone my abilities in the always developing world of web development.
