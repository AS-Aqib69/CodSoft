As a first web development project, creating a landing page has been a fascinating learning curve. I've acquired 
knowledge about the principles of web development, learned how to think analytically about design decisions,
and gained the confidence to continue my exploration of the online development industry. This experience
opened the road for my growth as a web developer and gave me a solid foundation to expand on.

Task 2: Portfolio Completed

I've learnt about responsive web design during this project, ensuring that my portfolio looks excellent on a variety of devices. My experience with debugging issues and cross-browser compatibility has taught me how to troubleshoot and offer a positive user experience. I have a solid foundation in HTML and CSS now that I've worked on this project, and I'm also more aware of web design principles and user-friendly content structure. As I take on additional tasks and investigate cutting-edge technologies, I'm eager to gain new skills and progress as a web developer.
