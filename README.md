As a first web development project, creating a landing page has been a fascinating learning curve. I've acquired 
knowledge about the principles of web development, learned how to think analytically about design decisions,
and gained the confidence to continue my exploration of the online development industry. This experience
opened the road for my growth as a web developer and gave me a solid foundation to expand on.
